## Summary
A Web App to assist working parents living in New York City identify childcare facilities per their preferences. 

## Problem Statement
As there are more than 3000 childcare facilities in New York City, It can be proven very difficult for a parent to compare and evaluate the safety conditions of all the facilities to identify the best options. 

Additionally, parents want these facilities to be at a convenient location, where they would not have to make a significant detour during their daily commute. 

Using the Web app, users can quickly identify all the childcare facilities located along the route of their daily commute. These facilities can be filtered based on user preferences. Moreover, they can observe the ranking of these facilities based on customized safety score metrics. They also have the option to compare two different facilities side by side to identify the best possible options.
